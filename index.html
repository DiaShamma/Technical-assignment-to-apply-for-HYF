          <p>
            Born on <strong>March 14, 1879</strong> in
            <strong>Ulm, Germany,</strong> I made the decision to drop out of
            school at a young age when my family moved to Milan, Italy in
            <strong>1894</strong>. Despite not finishing high school, I was able
            to pass the entrance exam for the
            <i>Swiss Federal Polytechnic</i> in Zurich, Switzerland and began
            studying there in <strong>1896</strong>. I excelled in my studies
            and graduated in <strong>1900</strong> with a degree in physics and
            mathematics. After graduation, I worked as a patent examiner in
            Bern, Switzerland.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1905</strong>, I made a significant impact on the scientific
            community when I published four groundbreaking papers in the journal
            <strong>"Annalen der Physik,"</strong> which established me as a
            leading scientist in the field. These papers introduced my theory of
            <strong>relativity</strong> and made significant contributions to
            the fields of quantum theory, statistical mechanics, and
            electromagnetism. I received my doctorate from the
            <i>University of Zurich</i> in <strong>1908</strong> and went on to
            hold academic positions at various universities in Europe, including
            the University of Prague and the University of Berlin.
            <strong>In 1914</strong>, I accepted a position at the Prussian
            Academy of Sciences in Berlin and became a German citizen. However,
            due to the rise of the Nazi Party and my Jewish heritage, I left
            Germany in <strong>1933</strong> and immigrated to the United
            States, where I took a position at <i>Princeton University</i>. I
            became a naturalized American citizen in <strong>1940</strong> and
            remained at Princeton until my retirement in <strong>1945</strong>.
            I passed away on April 18, 1955 in Princeton, New Jersey, leaving
            behind a legacy as one of the most influential and renowned
            scientists in history.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a young boy, I was a curious and bright student, but I struggled
            to conform to the strict and regimented nature of the school system
            when my family moved and I switched from a Catholic elementary
            school to a public school. Instead of focusing on rote learning and
            obedience, I preferred to explore my own interests, such as reading
            and playing the violin.

          <p>
            I developed the theory of <i>special relativity</i> in
            <strong>1905</strong>, which explains how the laws of physics are
            the same for all non-accelerating observers, regardless of their
            relative motion. The theory introduces the concept of space-time, a
            four-dimensional entity that combines space and time.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the theory, time passes more slowly in stronger
            gravitational fields, a phenomenon known as
            <i>time dilation</i>. This has been confirmed through experiments,
            including the <i>Hafele-Keating experiment</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            My equation <strong>E=mc^2</strong>, published in the same year,
            relates the energy of a particle to its mass and has had numerous
            applications, including in nuclear power and the behavior of
            <i>black holes</i>.

          <p>
            In 1915, I developed the theory of <i>general relativity</i>, which
            explains how gravity works by describing it as the curvature of
            space-time caused by the presence of matter and energy. The theory
            predicts that time passes more slowly in stronger gravitational
            fields, a phenomenon known as <i>time dilation</i>, which has been
            confirmed through experiments including the
            <i>Pound-Rebka experiment</i>. The theory has had numerous
            successful explanations and predictions, including the orbits of
            planets, the bending of light around massive objects, and the
            expansion of the universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The theory of <i>general relativity</i> also successfully predicted
            the <i>precession of the perihelion of Mercury</i> and the
            <i>gravitational redshift of light</i>, both later confirmed through
            observation.

          <h3 class="theory-title">The Theory of Electromagnetism</h3>
          <p>
            The theory of <i>electromagnetism</i> explains the relationship
            between electricity and magnetism as part of the electromagnetic
            field. Before my work in <strong>1905</strong>, electricity and
            magnetism were thought to be unrelated and described by separate
            laws. The theory states that electric and magnetic fields are
            different aspects of the electromagnetic field, described by
            <i>Maxwell's equations</i> published in <strong>1865</strong>. These
            equations predict the behavior of light, an electromagnetic wave,
            and have numerous applications, including in electric motors and
            generators, and technologies such as radio and radar.
          </p>
          <p>
            The theory of <i>electromagnetism</i> is now considered one of the
            fundamental theories of physics and is crucial in our understanding
            of the universe.

          <h3 class="theory-title">The theory of quantum mechanics</h3>
          <p>
            The theory of <i>quantum mechanics</i> explains the behavior of
            subatomic particles using the concept of wave-particle duality. It
            was developed in the early <strong>20th century</strong> to
            understand the behavior of atoms and molecules that couldn't be
            explained by classical physics. The theory uses
            <i>quantum mechanics</i>, a mathematical formalism that predicts the
            probability of finding a particle in a particular location or with a
            particular energy, but not the exact outcome of a measurement. This
            fundamental uncertainty is known as the
            <i>Heisenberg uncertainty principle</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The theory of <i>quantum mechanics</i> has had numerous
            applications, including in the explanation of the behavior of atoms
            and molecules and in the development of technologies such as
            transistors and lasers. It is now considered one of the fundamental
            theories of physics and is crucial in our understanding of the
            behavior of the universe at the atomic and subatomic scales.

        <div class="theory-info-card">
          <h3 class="theory-title">The photoelectric effect</h3>
          <p>
            The <i>photoelectric effect</i> is a phenomenon in which electrons
            are emitted from a metal surface when light is shone on it. I
            explained this effect in a series of papers published in
            <strong>1905</strong>, which was the first experimental evidence
            supporting the idea that light can be described as a particle, or
            photon. According to the theory of the <i>photoelectric effect</i>,
            when a photon with sufficient energy hits a metal surface, it can
            knock an electron out of the metal, transferring its energy to the
            electron and giving it kinetic energy. The energy of the photon is
            related to its frequency, with higher frequency photons having more
            energy, and the minimum energy required to eject an electron is
            known as the <i>work function</i> of the metal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <i>photoelectric effect</i> has had numerous applications,
            including in solar cells, photodetectors, and lasers, and is an
            important part of our understanding of the nature of light and its
            interaction with matter. It was recognized with the
            <i>Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921</i>.

          <h3 class="theory-title">The theory of cosmic inflation</h3>
          <p>
            The <i>theory of cosmic inflation</i> explains the rapid expansion
            of the universe during the first fraction of a second after the Big
            Bang, during which it increased in size by a factor of at least
            <strong>10^78</strong>. This rapid expansion smoothed out any
            irregularities, leading to the uniformity of the cosmic microwave
            background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe
            observed today. The theory was developed in the
            <strong>1980s</strong> and is supported by observational evidence,
            including the uniformity of the cosmic microwave background
            radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe. It is now
            considered a key part of the standard model of cosmology.
